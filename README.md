# Turtle-Bay

To-dos:
 - Update score as turtle moves (bottom of screen) (when we die we update the score, also need to do this when turtle moves. 15 mins)
 - Add score only if keypress is up (30 mins)
 - Ghost octopus problem (3 mins)
 - Restart button - attach event listener to all restart buttons (10min)
