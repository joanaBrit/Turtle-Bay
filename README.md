# Turtle-Bay
## General-Assembly


Taking the game Frogger as a reference, I created Turtle Bay. A turtle's journey begins when she is born and tries to get home. She needs to overcome some obstacles in her life to reach the deep sea, where she will be free!

## Overview

One week was the time given to me to build a grid-based game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game had certain requirements: it had to be playable for one player, have a start and an end, and the obstacles should be auto-generated. My version of the game features a turtle that navigates the board using the keyboard arrow buttons. She starts with 3 lives and 0 points, which will change over the course of the game. Whenever the turtle hits an obstacle, she will lose one life, points, and be directed to the starting position. The turtle's journey gets harder as she gets closer to the sea, but it's not impossible.


## Technologies

## HTML

* A title. 
* A grid wrapper whith all essential sections for the grid.
* Instructions, Game Over and Wins overlays with a start and restart button.
* A section for the grid which was generated by JavaScript.
* Audio elements for the background music.
* Lives and their respective images.
* Score to keep track of the points.


## CSS

* Basic styling as a centre alignment, font, colour, size and more.
* Grid style using flex-box.
* CSS building overlay for start, game over and wins.
* CSS Animation for the active characters, buttons, these ones with some colour-change animation.


## JavaScript

* Grid with a width 11 by 11, a total of 121 cells.
* Each row is selected for CSS purposes.
* Turtle and Obstacles positions.
* Keypress event to move the turtle.
* Functions for start game, reset game and end game.
* SetInterval to move obstacles, and speed.
* Click events to start and restart the game.
* Hide and show overlays.
* Play audio.


## Project Breakdown

* Day 1: I spent hours on a detailed wireframe and plan for my project. This included an example of the concept game, determining how many rows, where the obstacles could be situated and their direction, possible colour choices, describing which elements the HTML should have, and for JavaScript, the steps I should take.

* Day 2: I started to build the HTML, writing instructions, positioning the elements and giving classes and ids whenever I thought it was needed, also built the grid in JavaScript and had some time on  images searching.

* Day 3: I added the turtle to a starting position and, with the Keypress event, made the turtle move around the cells without moving out of the grid. I also added the obstacles to the grid and positioned them where I thought was a good position, both visually and in terms of gameplay.

* Day 4: I started with the animals' movements and made it as I wished for the obstacles close to the sea, in this case the sharks, to move at a faster speed using setInterval. While I was creating the movement for the obstacles, I was curious about what else I could do, so I tried many things. At some point, I discovered something that I found interesting to implement in the game: moving sharks around by 2 rows, which added an extra level of challenge.

* Day 5: I started the day by making the buttons event work, adding lives, inserting sounds at specific times to play, and displaying the score.

* Day 6: This was a very interesting day. While I was testing the game, I found that the turtle could pass an empty space in the seagull row without losing a life. I was surprised and tried to figure out the cause of that. I discovered that I had an issue with one of the seagulls - as you can see there are only 4 seagulls showing, while in the array there are positions for 5 seagulls.

How did I fix it?
I've tried to change the seagull position and it worked when I only used a maximum of 4 seagulls but well I wanted 5. I find a way to clean these seagulls from the cells with remove method, get new position for each seagull into an array and finally add the seagulls to a new position, it worked. In this day I was mostly fixing bugs, where i was able to learn a lot.

* Day 7: Working on CSS and fixing some issues. Working with CSS was one of my favourite parts of the process. I enjoyed exploring animations and effects that I could achieve, as well as seeing the visual results. I created overlays for the start and end, and also added a small animation to the button, where the text colour changes subtly. This change was meant to encourage players to press the button.

## Start Game

![Start overlay](<readmeimg/Start  overlay.png>)

* Start overlay with the instructions and a start button.


## Game In Progress

![Game in progress](<readmeimg/game in progress.png>)

* Start button was pressed, the music start to play.
* Turtle and obstacles get activated.
* Obstacles are moving checking if they have been hit.


### Main Character Movements

* The keypress event is used to move the character up, down, right and left.
* The turtle can't get out of the grid.
* Points are given whenever the turtle walk one row **up** (150 points) and are removed whenever hits an obstacle.
* Checks which direction the character is going and if it hits an obstacle it will remove a live.
* If the turtle loses all the 3 lives the game ends activating the Game Over overlay with a restart button.

![Game over overlay](<readmeimg/Game Over overlay.png>)

* To win the game the character need to arrive to the deep sea (first row), where the win overlay will display showing the total of score and a restart button.
* whenever this overlays are activated one of the background music stops.
* The game gets more difficult when the turtle gets closer to the sea.

## Key Learnings

* Learned how to use CSS animation.
* Learned how to make elements move in the grid, in the direction I want and as many rows I want.
* Learned how to play and control the audio.


## Challenges

* I found starting to move the obstacles a bit challenging.
* To increase the score only one time per row during the game.
* Also when I found the bug in the seagull row it took me a while to figure out a way to solve it.


## Future Improvements

* Improve the score to work more efficiently.
* I would like to rewrite the code. I had some ideas at the beginning that I thought would make the code easier for the next steps, but It was taking too long. Then I decided to proceed with the current code. 


## Bugs

* No obvious bugs, but there are still some things I want to improve.
